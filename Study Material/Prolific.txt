Title: Participating in a Short Conversation on Snapchat

Internal name: SnapchatFaceFeedbackStudy

Description:
I this study, we would like you to have a brief conversation with another participant via a video call within Snapchat. Thus you need to have or be willing to create a Snapchat account to participate. You can do so on your phone or tablet via the Snapchat app, or on any device with Snapchat for Web. The conversation will last about 5-10 minutes and you can pick the topic for the conversation. The video call does not start right away and instead you will first just be redirected to a website where we will ask you for consent and to schedule that call with you. So you can pick a time for the video call that works best for you. The call itself is not recorded and no personal information on you is collected. You can optionally give us a name or nickname with which we should address you during the call. After the video call has then concluded, we will ask you to fill out a short questionnaire on another website. We will share that link with you at the end of the call.
