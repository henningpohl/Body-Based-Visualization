Thanks for signing up for our study! For the video call you will need to connect to the user handle 'fall23study' (given name: Henning (Sebastian) Pohl) on Snapchat. Please add this user to your friend list before the call. After this study has concluded we will delete our account and thus also not appear in your friend list anymore. We will not retain any information on your Snapchat account and no data is recorded during our call. The only data we keep is from the questionnaire you have to fill out afterwards. We will send you a link to that questionnaire after our call has concluded.

At the scheduled time, please video call us via the Snapchat app or Snapchat on the web (https://web.snapchat.com/). We do not know which Snapchat account belongs to your Prolific ID, so we cannot initiate the call ourselves. Should you not be able to make it at that time after all, you can reschedule or cancel via the booking site.

During the video call we would like to just have a casual conversation. What we are trying to evaluate in this study is your opinion of a set of visualization elements that will become active during the call. These simulate augmented reality effects we believe could enhance conversations in real-life in the future. We have implemented five different visualization elements:
 - A virtual name tag that shows you the name of who you are speaking to.
 - An emotion tracker that analyzes the person you are talking to and gives you an estimate of their current mood. This is shown as a bar graph above their left eye, filling up more the happier they seem.
 - A weather notification widget that let's you know about upcoming changes to the weather around you. That widget floats next to the person you are talking to.
 - A message notification that let's you know about incoming text messages. These show up as text bubbles popping out from the side of the person you are talking to and show the number of unread messages.
 - A conversation clock that informs you how much time has already passed talking to that person. A green ring around the right eye shows seconds and blue marks above the eye show how many minutes have passed.
For an image of what these effects look like, please see: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/anhwsj3t90q5qd3fud7fw/EffectsPreview.jpg?rlkey=h7qv99g8v02e26q5bqivmyod3&dl=0

Note that the notifications are simulated and do not represent actual incoming messages or changing weather. For the purpose of this study, please imagine that the shown information is generated by your own device and thus personal to you. The person you are talking to is _not_ able to see these effects and these visualization elements are meant to be personal to you, even though they are shown on and around the other person's body.
