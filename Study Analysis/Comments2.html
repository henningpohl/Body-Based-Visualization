<h2>How would you describe the effect of those visualizations on the conversation from your perspective?</h2>

<ul>

<li>They gave information about the person and the call <i>(6135ce2a32b53777552a46b0 - P8)</i></li>

<li>The more distracting thing was the timer on the eye.  <i>(5f8f93586e3bb720c55869ff - P1)</i></li>

<li>The name tag was great so you don't have to make the person feel bad if you forgot their name. The weather notification was a bit annoying as it started raining on the person's face it was rather distracting. I liked the emotion detection so you are aware if the person is enjoying the conversation or getting bored . I'm not sure what the worm crawling on the person's face was for but that was also a bit distracting. <i>(647871fb42a6b6651b3a66b8 - P13)</i></li>

<li>I think they were quite useful especially the name tag and the emotion tracker. They were certainly quite interesting especially the emotion indicatior if it reallly showed your true emotions. <i>(650de189b6f20e6ef24e8578 - P16)</i></li>

<li>I really didn't mind having them on the screen, it's good to know how the other person is feeling and the timer also  it helped with keeping our time.  <i>(6161d0adb5f4801077840616 - P12)</i></li>

<li>Some were distracting and the others very useful <i>(6152d419629f8da49913f106 - P9)</i></li>

<li>I liked the appearance of the visualizations because they gave me a clear indication of how the person I was engaging with felt.  <i>(64f3ad25c93a6f6d60e6acd8 - P14)</i></li>

<li>While they might have given me helpful information, I think for me they worked best in keeping my focus on the screen, almost like the Reddit post being read with a subway surfers game. <i>(5fc51d0db609ae0e6834a36d - P2)</i></li>

<li>Since the conversation was good, they were not a distraction, but more of an added benefit to the conversation just to know the surroundings of the person  and the mood they are in. <i>(6120153a62e44ca1b6fa08c5 - P7)</i></li>

<li>Timer was not very intuitive, I didn't realize it's a timer at first. Emotion indicator rather small, had to look more closely at the screen than I would otherwise do. Name tag useful - it could decrease cognitive load - no need to try to retrieve a name from memory. <i>(6501c0a2e788b5556c24569d - P15)</i></li>

<li>I feel the video call was a bit too much, in terms of the visualizations, they were a bit distractive but I was able to keep up with the conversation. <i>(61176ed28c8935138ab6a64b - P6)</i></li>

<li>they were very interesting to have within the conversation but they did not take away from the conversation either. so they were not that distracting. <i>(60d1ac7ce6accf3bc85d834d - P3)</i></li>

<li>I think some were unnecessary but I was not distracted by them. The conversation flowed regardless.  <i>(615e80f8f7b842e4f5653268 - P10)</i></li>

<li>I think they were okay to have, whilst the weather one was a bit distractive and the moving green arc, I think they were unnoticeable for the most part and maybe that could have been due to the conversation we were having  <i>(60ec6288c8facd0e581b53f9 - P4)</i></li>

<li>I feel the visualizations were rather helpful/informative and  I never felt any distractions. <i>(6160ccb0810a73f90ef4c5e7 - P11)</i></li>

<li>To an extent it was very disturbing more so as I didn't really understand what each meant but with time I understand and was able to ignore them and continue to have a conversation.  <i>(610570cb1ba398e504f289d0 - P5)</i></li>

<h2>What do you think would be information that could be helpful for you to have in a conversation?</h2>

<ul>

<li>The person's name <i>(6135ce2a32b53777552a46b0 - P8)</i></li>

<li>That the other person tells me what he thinks of every subject I talk about. <i>(5f8f93586e3bb720c55869ff - P1)</i></li>

<li>Timer. So if you have another appointment you won't be late or maybe you have a limited amount of data so you let the person know instead of getting cut off. The emotions tracker so you can change the topic if the conversation is going down hill. <i>(647871fb42a6b6651b3a66b8 - P13)</i></li>

<li>So in my opinion it'd be at first the emotion tracker because even if the person was ceasing their emotions, you'd know how they truly feel. <i>(650de189b6f20e6ef24e8578 - P16)</i></li>

<li>I like the conversation I just had but I would like talking bit more about life experiences and share some good old stories  <i>(6161d0adb5f4801077840616 - P12)</i></li>

<li>The nametag as helpful and the conversation timer  <i>(6152d419629f8da49913f106 - P9)</i></li>

<li>The location of the person I had the conversation with.  <i>(64f3ad25c93a6f6d60e6acd8 - P14)</i></li>

<li>The distance and the time difference between the people in the conversation. <i>(5fc51d0db609ae0e6834a36d - P2)</i></li>

<li>I Liked the effect where it shows the mood of the person, based on the tone and movement of their bodies, it's a nice effect because it let's you know when the conversation is going good or not. I also like the weather effect, if only it showed they actually temperature of the place they are currently in.  <i>(6120153a62e44ca1b6fa08c5 - P7)</i></li>

<li>perhaps a very brief meeting agenda set as a transparent background text, becoming less transparent if tapped on. It would be in a form of a tick-able checklist. Such a list would be set prior to a call. The list would have a word limit.  <i>(6501c0a2e788b5556c24569d - P15)</i></li>

<li>The conversation clock is helpful to keep up with what I have to say, and finish.  <i>(61176ed28c8935138ab6a64b - P6)</i></li>

<li>notifications and timer  <i>(60d1ac7ce6accf3bc85d834d - P3)</i></li>

<li>The conversation timer, name tag and maybe the message notification!  <i>(615e80f8f7b842e4f5653268 - P10)</i></li>

<li>The name tag and the emotional indicators would be pretty helpful <i>(60ec6288c8facd0e581b53f9 - P4)</i></li>

<li>Message Notifications, Call Timer, mood, etc. <i>(6160ccb0810a73f90ef4c5e7 - P11)</i></li>

<li>Genuinely I do not think I would want to have a conversation like that again because with the changes it makes it can get distracting and the conversation could not reach it's full potential based on my partial distraction <i>(610570cb1ba398e504f289d0 - P5)</i></li>

<h2>What would, in your opinion, be the best way to visualize the information you got during the conversation?</h2>

<ul>

<li>Put it on the side, not on their face <i>(6135ce2a32b53777552a46b0 - P8)</i></li>

<li>How it was, was perfect. I just would change the position of timer. <i>(5f8f93586e3bb720c55869ff - P1)</i></li>

<li>Problem on the side of the screen and not on the person's face. <i>(647871fb42a6b6651b3a66b8 - P13)</i></li>

<li>I think that the name tag was pretty well presented as was the emotion tracker but I think the timer was a bit weird ( I'd prefer a normal one showing the digits of how much time elapsed). The weather tracker and notifications icon were OK but I think they're unnecessary. <i>(650de189b6f20e6ef24e8578 - P16)</i></li>

<li>It was pleasant and the information was helpful  <i>(6161d0adb5f4801077840616 - P12)</i></li>

<li>to section the information on one side of the screen instead of all over the face to avoid the caller to be distracted by it  <i>(6152d419629f8da49913f106 - P9)</i></li>

<li>Showing them on the sides rather than on the person's face.  <i>(64f3ad25c93a6f6d60e6acd8 - P14)</i></li>

<li>As AR "pop ups" around the face/on the face of the person we're talking to, selected from tiny menu on the side, that when pressed allows the user to choose what information he/she wants displayed during the call. <i>(5fc51d0db609ae0e6834a36d - P2)</i></li>

<li>I would have liked if it was a pop up that happened 1 by 1 and not everything at once, also if it had some sort of words, just key words during the conversation, that would also be useful.  <i>(6120153a62e44ca1b6fa08c5 - P7)</i></li>

<li>Emotion indicator - bigger would be useful, and perhaps not over the face, or displayed in a similar way to the over the face timer. Black colour wouldn't hack it, especially with people with darker, or even olive skin tone. <i>(6501c0a2e788b5556c24569d - P15)</i></li>

<li>The best way would be to have the information/visualizations on the side and not directly on the person's face. <i>(61176ed28c8935138ab6a64b - P6)</i></li>

<li>as a part of reality and not as distracting filters <i>(60d1ac7ce6accf3bc85d834d - P3)</i></li>

<li>Light bulb because it was interesting to hear about cuisine from a different culture.  <i>(615e80f8f7b842e4f5653268 - P10)</i></li>

<li>I think subtitles tend to be pretty much more helpful and maybe its because I am more fond of them  <i>(60ec6288c8facd0e581b53f9 - P4)</i></li>

<li>The idea of displaying it the way it was displayed is pretty much good and might just need to be tweaked a bit for best visual image. <i>(6160ccb0810a73f90ef4c5e7 - P11)</i></li>

<li>It would definitely be better if I was not on the person's face and probably in a certain space on the screen and not to display all at once.  <i>(610570cb1ba398e504f289d0 - P5)</i></li>
